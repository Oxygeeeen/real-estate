# Getting Started

Run the following commands before starting the app

- `yarn` or
- `npm i`

Depending on your system requirements. This will install all the packages that are needed to run the app.

# env example

You need to have a `.env` file with your API Key.
eg: `RAPID_API_KEY="b71bf074camsh74d8c0..."`

# Start The App

Then run

- `yarn dev` or
- `npm run dev`

# Deploy the app

Please follow the instructions for [Vercel](#deployment) here

# ========================

# Default Instructions for Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
